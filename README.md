# PyWord
This is a project to make Word in Python. Known as PyWord.
## Dependencies/Pips
There are no dependencies that you will have to manually install. PyWord currently uses the `tkinter` and the `os` libraries in Python, both of which do not require to be installed.
The goal of this is to not use any pips to recreate Microsoft Word in Python.
Hence the name PyWord.
